caption: "The image is a line graph that shows the number of illegal immigrants in the United States from 2012 to 2014. The x-axis represents the years, starting from 2012 and ending in 2014, with the y-axis representing the percentage of immigrants.

The graph is divided into three sections, each representing a different year. The first section is titled "Illegal Immigration into the U.S." and shows that the majority of immigrants from the US have been illegal immigrants, while the second section is labeled "Biden World Record Illegal Immigrants, Many from Prisons and Mental Institutions, Also Terrorists."

There are three bars in the graph, each with a different colorâ€”orange, blue, and red. The orange bars represent the percentage, the blue bars represent Trump's family detention policy, and the red bars represent DACA (DACA) and Daca. The graph also shows that there is a significant increase in the number and percentage of people who have been incarcerated in the US since 2012, with a significant decrease in the percentage. The chart also includes a legend that explains the meaning of each bar."
