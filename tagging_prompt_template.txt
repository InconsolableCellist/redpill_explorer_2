There are three bars in the graph, each with a different colorâ€”orange, blue, and red. The orange bars represent the percentage, the blue bars represent Trump's family detention policy, and the red bars represent DACA (DACA) and Daca. The graph also shows that there is a significant increase in the number and percentage of people who have been incarcerated in the US since 2012, with a significant decrease in the percentage. The chart also includes a legend that explains the meaning of each bar."
